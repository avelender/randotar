OAuth2 Developer Guide
Introduction

OAuth2 allows Orbitar users to create client applications and let other users connect to them securely.

A client application is a software program that accesses resources or services on behalf of a user through the OAuth2 protocol. In the Orbitar ecosystem, client applications can use Orbitar's API after getting authorization from users. These applications can be web apps, mobile apps, desktop applications, or server-side applications that connect with Orbitar's platform.

This guide will help you understand how to create and use OAuth2 client applications.
Creating a Client Application

To create a client application, follow these steps:

    Log in to your Orbitar account

    Go to your profile, then enter Settings / Applications

    Click "Зарегистрировать своё приложение" button at the bottom of the page

    Fill in the required information:
        Name: Your application name (2-32 characters)
        Description: What your app does (up to 255 characters)
        Redirect URIs: Where users will be sent after authorization (comma-separated list)
        App connection URL (optional): The URL where users will go when clicking the "Connect" button on your application card. This URL is usually the landing page of your application.

    After creating your application, you will receive:
        Client ID: Public identifier for your application
        Client Secret: Private key that must be kept secure

Important:

    Store your Client Secret safely. If you lose it or need to change it for security reasons, you can regenerate it in your application settings.
    After creating your application, you can upload a logo for it. You cannot upload a logo during the initial creation process.

Promoting Your Application

You can promote your application to other Orbitar users by embedding app cards in posts or comments.

To embed your app card, use this format:

<app>{client_id}</app>

Replace {client_id} with your actual client ID. For example:

<app>550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000</app>

The embedded card will show:

    Your app name
    Description
    Logo (if you uploaded one)
    "Connect" button (if you provided an App connection URL)

Understanding OAuth2 Flow

OAuth2 in Orbitar uses the "Authorization Code" flow, which is defined in RFC 6749, section 4.1:

    Authorization Request: Your app asks the user for permission
    Authorization Grant: User approves the request
    Code Redirect: Orbitar redirects to your app with an authorization code
    Token Exchange: Your app exchanges the code for access tokens
    API Access: Your app uses the access token to make API requests

Step 1: Authorization Request

Redirect the user to Orbitar's authorization endpoint:

https://orbitar.space/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&scope=REQUESTED_SCOPES&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&state=RANDOM_STATE_STRING

Parameters:

    client_id: Your application's Client ID
    scope: Space-separated list of permissions your app needs
    redirect_uri: Must match one of the URIs you registered
    state: Random string for security validation (see security note below)

Note: If you provided an App connection URL, you have two options for this URL:

    Set it directly to Orbitar's authorization endpoint with the parameters above (you would need to hardcode the state parameter)
    Set it to a URL in your app that will then redirect users to Orbitar's authorization endpoint (recommended)

The second option is more secure and gives you more control.

Security Note about State Parameter: The state parameter serves multiple security purposes:

    Preventing CSRF attacks: It ensures the authorization request came from your application
    Session binding: It binds the authorization request to the user's session
    Protection against replay attacks: It prevents authorization codes from being reused

To implement this correctly, your application must:

    Generate a unique, unpredictable state value for each authorization request
    Store this value in the user's session or other secure storage
    Verify that the state returned in the callback exactly matches the stored state
    Reject the authorization if the state validation fails

Step 2: User Authorization

The user will see a consent screen showing:

    Your application name and description
    Your username (the developer/creator of the application)
    The permissions your app is requesting
    Buttons to approve or deny

Step 3: Authorization Code

If the user approves, Orbitar will redirect to your redirect_uri with an authorization code:

https://your-app.example/callback?code=CODE&state=RANDOM_STATE_STRING

This code is temporary and expires quickly. The state parameter should match the one you sent in the authorization request.
Step 4: Token Exchange

Your application must exchange this code for access and refresh tokens. You can authenticate using either Basic Authentication in the header or by including client credentials in the request body.

Method 1: Using Basic Authentication (recommended)

POST https://api.orbitar.space/api/v1/oauth2/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic BASE64(CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET)

grant_type=authorization_code&code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE&nonce=RANDOM_STRING&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI

Method 2: Including client credentials in request body

POST https://api.orbitar.space/api/v1/oauth2/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=authorization_code&code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE&nonce=RANDOM_STRING&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET

Parameters:

    grant_type: Must be "authorization_code"
    code: The authorization code received from the previous step
    nonce: Optional random string for additional security
    redirect_uri: Must match the URI used in the authorization request
    client_id: Your application's Client ID (if using Method 2)
    client_secret: Your application's Client Secret (if using Method 2)

The response contains:

{
  "access_token": "ACCESS_TOKEN",
  "refresh_token": "REFRESH_TOKEN",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "scope": "GRANTED_SCOPES",
  "expires_in": 1800
}

Step 5: Using Access Tokens

Include the access token in API requests to Orbitar:

POST https://api.orbitar.space/api/v1/status
Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN

Note: Make sure the scopes you requested during authorization include access to the endpoints you plan to use. For example, to access the /api/v1/status endpoint, your authorized scopes must include permission for this resource.
Step 6: Refreshing Tokens

Access tokens expire after a period of time (usually 30 minutes). Use the refresh token to get a new access token. You can authenticate using either Basic Authentication in the header or by including client credentials in the request body.

Method 1: Using Basic Authentication (recommended)

POST https://api.orbitar.space/api/v1/oauth2/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic BASE64(CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET)

grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=REFRESH_TOKEN

Method 2: Including client credentials in request body

POST https://api.orbitar.space/api/v1/oauth2/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=REFRESH_TOKEN&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET

If the refresh token has expired, you'll need to initiate a new authorization flow for the user starting from Step 1.
Scopes

Scopes define what your application can access. Orbitar automatically creates scopes based on API routes. Scopes follow a hierarchy where more specific permissions are grouped under more general ones.
Scope Hierarchy

Scopes are built from API routes using the following rules:

    URL paths are converted to scopes by replacing slashes with colons
    More general scopes include more specific ones
    When a general scope is granted, all its sub-scopes are implicitly granted

For example, an API endpoint /api/v1/user/profile generates these hierarchical scopes:

    user (most general)
    user:profile (more specific)

If your application has the user scope, it automatically has access to all user:* sub-scopes, including user:profile, user:settings, etc.
Examples of Scope Hierarchy

    Post management scopes:
        post (access to all post-related endpoints)
        post:create (create new posts)
        post:edit (edit existing posts)
        post:comment (comment on posts)
        post:get (retrieve posts)

    Requesting just the post scope grants access to all post operations.

    User-related scopes:
        user (access to all user endpoints)
        user:profile (view user profiles)
        user:save (save user profile settings)
        user:settings (access user settings)

    Other important scopes:
        feed (access to feed endpoints)
        site (access to site endpoints)
        site:subscribe (subscribe to sites)
        vote (voting capabilities)
        notifications (access user notifications)

How API Routes Map to Scopes

Here are examples of how API routes map to scope names:
API Route 	Generated Scopes
/api/v1/status 	status
/api/v1/user/profile 	user, user:profile
/api/v1/post/create 	post, post:create
/api/v1/site/subscribe 	site, site:subscribe

When requesting scopes, ask for the most specific scope your application needs. The system will automatically remove redundant scopes. For example, if you request both user and user:profile, only the more general user scope will be used because it already includes user:profile access.
Security Best Practices

    Keep Client Secret secure: Never expose it in client-side code
    Use HTTPS: Always use secure connections
    Validate redirect URIs: Prevent open redirector attacks
    Request minimum scopes: Only ask for permissions you need
    Handle token expiration: Properly refresh tokens when needed
    Make sure to pass and validate the state parameter during the authorization process

Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

    Invalid redirect URI: Make sure the URI matches exactly what you registered
    Invalid client credentials: Check your client ID and secret
    Invalid scopes: Make sure requested scopes are valid
    Expired authorization code: Codes expire quickly, exchange them immediately
    Expired access token: Use refresh token to get a new access token
